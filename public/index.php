<h2>Hello and welcome to my page!</h2>


<p>
    I am an award nominated actress based in Leeds, West Yorkshire. I have two crazy children whom I adore, a lovely husband (who happened to make this site for me) and a one-eyed cat named Odin.
</p>

<p>
    I recently played Isabella Linton in Jorvik Rep Theatre Company’s Wuthering Heights and next year I will appear in a feature film which is currently in pre-production. I am also due to appear in Dracula, The Tempest and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (I do love Shakespeare).
</p>

<p>
    I am currently taking the Acting for Film and Television Course with Northern Star Acting. Whilst away on an Actor’s Bootcamp with the Northern Star Acting tribe, I took part in filming Heno on Welsh channel S4C. I also played Perdita in Calverley Players extract from The Winter’s Tale.
</p>

<p>
    As well as acting I am also a company director of Jungle Rumble Soft Play. This is a children’s soft play centre that is currently under construction (so to speak). I love running and last year completed six 10K races for the charity Educate the Kids.
</p>

<p>
    My other hobbies include film and theatre (naturally) and reading, I particularly like Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. I’m a friendly person and pretty easy to get along with (unless you’re a bully, I don’t like bullies) so please feel free to get in touch and have a chat. Follow me on Facebook and Twitter to be kept upto date and check out my blog if the life and opinions of a Yorkshire actress pique your interest.

    Thanks for visiting!
